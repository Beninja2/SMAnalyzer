# SMAnalyzer
SMAnalyzer was designed and built by Ben Ciummo, Kailee Calhoun, Amber Owens, Matteo Pezzino, Salvador Lopez Jr, and Lisa Wherly.
This project will serve as their Senior Capstone project for the Washburn University CIS Program. 

SMAnalyzer (Social Media Analyzer) is an application that leverages APIs from various social media platforms, to provide detailed statistical and trend analyasis to the user.
The nature of this analyasis is primarily focused on trimming down large groups of comments into prevelant topics, and providing more detail on each of those topics.
Similar to the way Facebook, Twitter, and other applications identify trends for their sites as a whole, SMAnalyzer is able to do so on a specific and targeted level at the user's discretion.
Practical applications of this algorithm would involve its use in a social media marketing scenario where individuals do not necessarily administer a facebook page, but still want details on that pages posts and responses.
It could also be used to interpret survey data to identify common ideas within a large amount of comments be it social media data or not.
